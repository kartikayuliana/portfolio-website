            I'm a passionate UI/UX designer with a strong eye for detail and a deep understanding of user-centered design. Skilled in tools like Figma, Canva, CorelDRAW, and CapCut, I blend creativity and usability to create intuitive, engaging, and visually compelling digital experiences. My goal is to design interfaces that not only look great but also feel natural and accessible for every user.
